# BWB fork of TomasBarry/SublimeLinter-contrib-erblint

## Objective

`SublimeLinter-contrib-erblint` does not use the project's `erblint` settings because it is creating a temporary file and sending that temp file to the linter. The Rubocop plugin for Sublime handles this very well, so I am trying to use the Rubocop algorithm to improve the functionality of this package.
